throughout iteration 3, I worked on the next 10 user stories of my system where alot of the features
introduced are about price data and comparing grocery prices through new features implemented.
I worked on scraping data from Dunnes and Aldi and did alot of work on the basket users can build
and narrowed the use of that down.

user story 11 - see promotions, offers and discounts
created 3 calling cards on index.html which display live
promotions, offers and discounts of current products

user story 12 - see member pricing
member pricing displayed under real price on search.html,
different member pricing dependant on retailer, 10 percent off
for supervalu, N/A for Aldi and Vouchers available for Dunnes

user story 13 - select store region
created a filter dropdown option in the navbar of search.html
similar to filtering by category or by retailer but with region

user story 14 - include all fees
all fees including delivery, service and bag fees added onto final price
to give grand total, seen on basket.html page, different dependant on the retailer
chosen

user story 15 - set a budget limit
option to set a budget limit on the nav of basket.html where if the user enters a
budget and brings spending over that a message of warning appears

user story 16 - see a savings summary of my basket
savings summary calculated under grand total comparing the current cost at
retailer where user is shopping compared to other retailers

user story 17 - compare two baskets side by side
allows two users to build 2 baskets sid by side to compare, click compare basket
from dropdown with single basket and choose compare and build and add items
to basket 1 and 2 respectively

user story 18 - see split store savings
calculated similarly to summary savings but uses all retailers combined to
get cheapest possible total, seen below building a basket

user story 19 - split store threshold
has to be more 15 percent of original spending to decide if split store
purchases is worth it, a message will appear saying if to do so or not

user story 20 - substitute products
sub products available matching from database by similar name and price with
same retailer and region, button next to product in basket will allow user
to view substitute and add it to basket to replace other products
