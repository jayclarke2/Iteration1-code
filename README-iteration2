During this iteration, I worked on the next 7 user stories of my system focusing on implementing
core features of the system that users will interact with to be able to compare grocery prices and
I also created a scraper that obtains supervalus live product data.

supervalu-scraper:
I created a python code that scrapes live product data from Ryans Supervalu in Grange
and stores the data in mysql database, I did this by setting up a connection to my database,
obtaining category ID's and names and setting up category API endpoints where the API headers
mimic a real browser and scroll through the pages of supervalus website. It scrapes product name, price
image url etc and stores the info in my database, I can run this script to get live data.

User story 4 - Filter by retailer/category:
- created a filter dropdown allowing users to select their preferred retailer and category
- it will load products based on their selections getting the info through a sql query sent to my database
- as of now only SuperValu and their specific categories are available but I plan to adapt to include
other retailers and put products into more general categories

User story 5 - Sort by price/unit price:
- similar to user story 4, users can select a drop down to filter by price
low to high, high to low and same for unit price.
- users filtering options are saved to the query when they sort by price, it does not reset.
- this allows users to search for cheapest products and save money on groceries

User story 6 - View product details:
- there is a view details button next to each product on the search page when clicked it brings users to a specific html page for that product.
- it passes the id of the product in the url to my python backend which in turn sends it to a html file for display
- on this html file there is more detail of the product available along with buttons to add to basket and more

User story 7 - See store region:
- the store region where the product came from is displayed under each products name
- the region name comes from the scraper where it is saved to the database
- displayed under each product name

User story 8 - Compare equivalent products:
- on the home page users can search for products like a general query
- it returns only one product per retailer so they can just quickly get a jist of the prices
- when more retailers are added, it will show one product per retailer

User story 9 - Add items and quantities to a basket:
- I added an add to basket button which adds products to a basket along with the quantity entered.
- it multiplys the product price by the quantity to get the basket total
- if users add to basket without a quantity, it automatically is set to 1
- this allows users to build their cheapest possible basket of their preferred retailer.

User story 10 - See a basket total:
- the basket total calculated in user story 9 is displayed using a cart_total function
- it uses an app.context processer allowing the total to be displayed on any html page
- the basket total can be seen in the top right of the search page or upon viewing the full basket.
