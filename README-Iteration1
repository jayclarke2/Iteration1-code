During this iteration, I implemented the first three user stories providing basic functionality and enabling
users to interact with a functioning system, these are a user login and registration, allowing users to
search for a product by name and the products displaying the unit price and when it was last updated.

The core functionality of add, editing and delete products was added in the environment so app.py and the html
files of edit_product, products and index have seen minimal changes.

User story 1 - Login, registration or continue as guest:
- created a login form with username and password
- users can register a username and password and login with those credentials
- username and password is stored in my database
- to login users must have a registered account in my database
- continue as guest brings users directly to the home page

User story 2 - Search for products by name:
- added a search bar where users can type products name, works with numbers and words
- search results will display partial results to what product has been typed
- displays search results in a clear structured way with respective rows to that product including the image of the product
- users have the option to return back to the home page

User story 3 - See unit price, price and last updated of products:
- updated product display to show the unit price calculation of the product and when it was last updated
- unit price obtains the name and price of the product from my database and calculates it displayed with the type
- last updated formatted in dd/mm/yyyy for user readability.
